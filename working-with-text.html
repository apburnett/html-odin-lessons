        <p>
            I am trying out different type of HTML functions, 
            including <em>Italicised</em> and <strong>Bold</strong> text.
        </p>
            <!--Comment reagarding the first paragraph-->
        <p>
            <em>This is my second paragaph in italics.</em>
        </p>
            <!--Comment regarding the second paragaph-->
        <p>
            <strong>This is my third paragraph in bold.</strong>
        </p>
            <!--Comment regarding the third paragaph-->
